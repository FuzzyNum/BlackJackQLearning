<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Gymnasium is a common library for Reinforcement Learning training and development. Since my main interests are in AI and ML, the Gymnasium environments were a perfect opportunity to practice implementing these algorithms for different problems. The environments implemented in this repository are representative of many multi-state problems with varying observation and action spaces for the game Agent. Check out the code and let me know if you find any issues. If you just want more help with AI/ML, I'll be happy to communicate with you.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Each folder with a relevant environment contains an image of example results in episode length, error, and rewards. Use those as comparisons for your results. Implementations may require additional blocks of code to make sure that all dependencies are met. These include Numpy, TQDM, MatPlotLib.pyplot, Gymnasium, PyGame, Moviepy, and Seaborn. Make sure you check your versions!

_For more examples, please refer to the [Documentation](https://example.com)_
